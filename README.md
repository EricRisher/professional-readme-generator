  ## Description
  This README generator saves time, ensures consistency, and lets developers focus on coding. It's about making projects more accessible and teamwork smoother.

  I created this project to make README creation quicker and more consistent. Our goal is to save developers time, maintain professionalism, and improve overall project accessibility.

  This project solves the challenge of time-consuming and inconsistent README creation. By automating this process, it streamlines documentation, saving developers time and ensuring a consistently professional and accessible project overview.
 

  ## Installation
  After installation is complete, run the following code: ‘node inex.js’ in the terminal. Answer the prompts and after completion, you should see a console log showing your answers to your prompts, a message that says ‘File created!’, and you should see your file under the ‘dist’ folder called ‘generatedREADME’. It’s generated in mark down syntax so you can copy and paste that code into your project!
